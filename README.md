## Fonts
flexcss includes a custom font set of fontello (http://fontello.com/),
you can disable including this by overwriting `$includeFontello` and set it to `false`

Either way, there is also a mixin called `icon` which you can use to setup a font.

## Development

Requires node to be installed.
run `npm install`, `bower update` and `gulp` to start a local dev server on Port `5757`
